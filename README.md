## üß† Methodology Overview

1. **Dataset**

   * Based on the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**, containing patient health metrics such as:

     * Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate, etc.
   * Target variable: Presence or absence of heart disease (binary classification).

2. **Preprocessing Steps**

   * Missing value handling
   * One-hot encoding for categorical features
   * Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
   * Train-test split to ensure model generalization

3. **Models Tested**

   * Logistic Regression
   * Random Forest
   * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   * Decision Tree
   * Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
   * Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

4. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * Accuracy
   * Precision
   * Recall
   * F1 Score
   * ROC-AUC

## üìä Key Results

| Model                 | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC-AUC  |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression   | 0.85     | 0.84      | 0.86   | 0.85     | 0.91     |
| Random Forest         | **0.88** | 0.87      | 0.89   | 0.88     | **0.93** |
| SVM (RBF)             | 0.86     | 0.85      | 0.87   | 0.86     | 0.92     |
| Neural Network (ReLU) | 0.84     | 0.83      | 0.85   | 0.84     | 0.90     |

The **Random Forest** model achieved the highest overall accuracy and ROC-AUC score, indicating strong predictive performance and balanced classification.
